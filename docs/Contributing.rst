Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome and are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

Code Formatting
----------------

We use `AutoPEP8`_ for code formatting and standardization. Check out the `pyproject.toml`_ file at root directory.

Report Bugs
-----------

Report bugs through `Github issue`_.

Please report all relevant information and preferably code that exhibits the
problem.

Do not try to email us about the issues, we will not respond to any emails, submit a proper Github issue instead.

Fix Bugs

Look through the `Github issue`_ for bugs. Anything is open to whoever
wants to implement it.

Implement Features
------------------

Look through the `Github issue`_ or `Malaya-project`_ for feature requests. Any
unassigned ``improvement`` issue is open to whoever wants to implement
it.

We use a frozen graph Tensorflow, you should be able to freeze any Tensorflow (version 1.15 and above) or Keras models.

Dataset Contributions

Create a new issue in `Github issue`_ that's related to your data including the
data link or just attach it there. If you want to improve the current dataset
we have, you can check at `Malaya-Dataset`_.

Alternatively, you can simply email your data if you do not want to expose the data
